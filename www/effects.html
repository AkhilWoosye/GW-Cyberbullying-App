					<h2>Effects</h2>
					<p>
						Research has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization. Victims
						may have lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and a variety of emotional responses,
						including being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed. Cyberbullying may be more harmful than
						traditional bullying, because there is no escaping it. One of the most damaging effects is that a
						victim begins to avoid friends and activities, which is often the very intention of the bully.
						Have a look at the two most dangerous effects cause by cyberbullying on a person.

							<h4>Intimidation, emotional damage, suicide</h4>
							<p>According to the Cyberbullying Research Center, "there have been several high profile cases involving teenagers taking their own
								lives in part because of being harassed and mistreated over the Internet, a phenomenon we have termed cyberbullicide suicide
								indirectly or directly influenced by experiences with online aggression." Cyberbullying is an intense form of psychological abuse,
								whose victims are more than twice as likely to suffer from mental disorders compared to traditional bullying. The reluctance youth
								have in telling an authority figure about instances of cyberbullying has led to fatal outcomes. At least three children between the
								ages of 12 and 13 have committed suicide due to depression brought on by cyberbullying.

							<h4>On youth and teenagers</h4>
							<p>The effects of cyberbullying vary, but research illustrates that cyberbullying adversely affects youth to a higher degree than
								adolescents and adults. Youth are more likely to suffer since they are still growing mentally and physically. Most of the time
								cyberbullying goes unnoticed; the younger generation hides their bullying from anyone that can help to prevent the bullying from
								occurring and from getting worse. Between 20% and 40% of adolescents are victims of cyberbullying worldwide. The youth slowly change
								their behaviors and actions so they become more withdrawn and quiet, but this may go unnoticed since the change is subtle. If preventive
								actions are not taken against cyberbullying, younger children in addition to teenagers will feel more lonely and depressed along with
								having significant changes in their eating and sleeping patterns as well as loss of interest in their normal activities. These changes
								will affect their growth and development into adulthood. Younger children and teenagers are 76.2% less likely to display suicidal behaviors
								and thoughts, but are still at risk depending on other factors such as mental health status, home care, and relationships with others. The
								risk of suicide increases by 35% to 45% when victims do not have any support from anyone in their life, and cyberbullying amplifies the
								situation.

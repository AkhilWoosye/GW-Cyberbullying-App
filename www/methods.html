							<h4>Social Media</h4>
							<p>Cyberbullying can take place on social media sites such as Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter. "By 2008, 93% of young people
								between the ages of 12 and 17 were online. In fact, youth spend more time with media than any single other activity besides
								sleeping." There are many risks attached to social media sites, and cyberbullying is one of the larger risks. One million
								children were harassed, threatened or subjected to other forms of cyberbullying on Facebook during the past year while 90
								percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed online cruelty say they have ignored mean behavior on social media,
								and 35 percent have done so frequently. 95 percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed cruel behavior on social

							<h4>SMS</h4>
							<p>
								Text bullying has become a serious problem among adolescents and teens. It can have devastating consequences, and parents may
								not even know it’s occurring. Parents can play an important role in preventing text bullying and helping teens who have been
								the victim of a bullying through text messages. Text bullying is sending mean, embarrassing, untrue, or hurtful message to or
								about someone using cell phone text messaging. This can also include sexting, or sending sexually suggestive text messages to
								someone or about someone. Many kids get cell phones when they are in middle school, which is when bullying, including text
								bullying, is most common. Approximately 9 out of 10 teens have a cell phone, and about 1 in 5 will be victims of a text bully.
								About 1 in 10 teens engage in text bullying. Bullying via text messaging has become more common than traditional bullying,
								especially among girls.

							<h4>Email</h4>
							<p>
								Email bullying mostly occur in workplace. It is now named as Workplace Bullying. According to the Workplace Bullying Institute,
								“workplace bullying is repeated, health-harming mistreatment of one or more persons (the targets) by one or more perpetrators
								that” includes verbal and nonverbal abuse that is threatening, humiliating, or intimidating. Workplace bullying is prompted
								“by perpetrators’ need to control the targeted individual(s), or initiated by bullies who choose their targets, timing,
								location, and methods.”  Such workplace bullying–the nonverbal kind–can occur by email or posts on Web-based social media such
								as Facebook or Twitter; another term for Web-based bullying of this kind is workplace cyber-bullying.

							<h4>Instant Message</h4>
							<p>
								Instant messaging is basically a simulated 'conversation', occurring in real-time, with short, typed messages. Almost 93 per
								cent of children use the internet. Many would use instant messaging programs such as MSN, Yahoo!, and AOL each night. Many
								children do not realise that instant messaging conversations are recorded. A bully can copy and paste the private information
								from these conversations into an email, and send it to hundreds of people at the click of a button. Many people also try to
								use other people's screen-names or email addresses, to trick you into thinking they are one of your friends, to get personal
								information from you. "You feel as if no one can help you," says Alyssa, 14, who waited two weeks before telling anyone that
								she was being bullied by a boy who called her 'loser' and 'stupid' in instant messages. "It's a lonely, scary feeling."

							<h4>Games</h4>
							<p>
								Gaming was a more common venue for men in which to experience harassment, whereas women's harassment tended to occur via
								social media. Most respondents considered gaming culture to be equally welcoming to both genders, though 44% thought it
								favored men. Sexual harassment in gaming generally involves slurs directed towards women, sex role stereotyping, and
								overaggressive language. The sexual harassment is part of the culture. If you remove that from the fighting game community,
								it's not the fighting game community. Some game developers have been subjected to harassment and death threats by players
								upset by changes to a game or by a developer's online policies. The comments were widely condemned by gamers, with comments
								in support of sexual harassment "drowned out by a vocal majority of people expressing outrage, disappointment and sympathy.
